This project focuses on the design and modeling of a small-scale wind tunnel developed using NASA-derived aerodynamic and flow similarity equations to ensure predictable and repeatable test conditions. The tunnel geometry, including the contraction cone, test section, and diffuser, was analytically sized to achieve uniform velocity profiles.

The structure was designed for additive manufacturing, with modular, 3D-printable components that allow rapid iteration, easy assembly, and low-cost experimental testing. This system enables benchtop aerodynamic using established wind tunnel design principles.

Due to this projects scale, it is still ongoning and final images will be released after asemmbly.
